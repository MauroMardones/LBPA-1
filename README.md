# LBPA-1
Length-based Pseudo-cohort Analysis Guide

This guide contains functions to compile and run the Length-based PseudoCohort Analysis (LBPA) fisheries stock assessment method in data limited conditions

This model is an estimation model by fitting to length composition data to estimate annual fishing mortality, annual recruitment and spawning potential ratio (SPR)

LBPA was developed for data-limited fisheries, where few data are available other than a representative sample of the size structure of the vulnerable portion of the population (i.e., length composition data from the catch) and an understanding of the life history of the species.

-Basic functionality

The LBPA model is built based on a C ++ language programmed in ADMB, and below we provide the steps to compile and build from a simple code implemented in R that had next step.

To do this, you must have installed the ADMB version (12 or newer). Can download in this site: <http://www.admb-project.org/>

The LBPA model and data example can be obtained from <https://github.com/criscan/LBPA>
